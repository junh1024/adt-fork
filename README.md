Ambisonic Decoder Toolbox-fork
=========================

This is my fork of the "Ambisonic Decoder Toolbox" found at https://bitbucket.org/ambidecodertoolbox/adt originally by Aaron J. Heller.

This fork is intended to be for practical audio use, not for academic use.

Aim is to make it more usable & compact by:

* removing large uneeded files
* disabling plots (plots take up time to generate, and result in OOM errors on PCs with low RAM. Disabling them makes generation much faster & less errors) 
* compressing PDFs

The upshot is that it is now only takes up ~10M.
