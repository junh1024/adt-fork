Ambisonic Decoder Toolbox-fork
=========================

This is my fork of the "Ambisonic Decoder Toolbox" found at https://bitbucket.org/ambidecodertoolbox/adt originally by Aaron J. Heller.

Aim is to make it more usable & compact by:

* removing large uneeded files
* disabling plots
* compressing PDFs
* etc
